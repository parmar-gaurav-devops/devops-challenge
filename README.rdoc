## DevOps challenge

First of all thanks for being part of this process :)

## Entering the Matrix.

Hello NEO.

We have a Rails application that says Hello world! But is becoming really popular.
Our old infrastructure run in EC2 machines but the maintenance of this is really hard for us.
We hear that we can use containers in order to build and ship our application in a fast and safe way.

You should choose between two pills:

[The red pill]: You can take the control of the Matrix and run the containers under self managed AWS EC2/GCP VM instances.

[The blue pill]: You take this and you wake up using AWS Fargate/GCP Cloud Run.

Please explain the reason for your decision.
After you take a choice, please complete the following tasks.

1. Create the infrastructure and the pipeline needed in order to serve our application from AWS/GCP containers.
2. Host our database in AWS RDS/ GCP SQL and import the current data (/db/database.sql).
3. Create a script that easy deploy new code to the stack.
4. Set autoscaling policies in order to have a minimum of 1 task, a desired of 1, and a maximum of 10 based on the CPU usage.
5. Add some simple observability solution where we can monitor the app: APM or logs or both if you have the time.

## Application details:

* Ruby version: 2.3.x
* Rails version: 4.2
* Postgres version :11.6

Database configuration: config/database.yml
Update your host.
username: admin
password: admin
db name: hello_world

## Test your results

Is everithing is ok the route /hello_world will return the following respose:
{"id":1,"text":"Hello World!"}
